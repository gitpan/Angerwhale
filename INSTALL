To install Angerwhale, you'll need a few C libraries available.  It's
best to install these from your OS's package repository, but not a
requirement:

   libxml2  (libxml2-dev on debian)
   expat    (libexpat-dev)
   gd       (libgd2-xpm-dev)
   htmltidy (libtidy-dev)

Optionally:

   gpm3     (libgpm3-dev)

Once you've installed that, run:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make installdeps
   make
   make test

Then you can run Angerwhale via the scripts in the scripts/ directory.
Installing it to your system will work, but is not recommended.  (Too
much clutter for my liking, anyway.)
