This is Angerwhale, a Catalyst-based blogging package.  Run
Makefile.PL and make test to get all the dependencies (and make sure
they work), and then run script/angerwhale_server.pl and visit
localhost:3000 to try it out.  If you want to "productionize" Angerwhale,
running "make install" is probably not what you want to do.  Please
refer to the Catalyst manual, and deploy Angerwhale as you see fit.

* AGAIN: RUNNING "MAKE INSTALL" IS PROBABLY NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO
